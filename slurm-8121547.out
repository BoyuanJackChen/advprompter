Grammar:

Financial markets can be manipulated through various means, including the use of complex financial instruments, such as derivatives and hedge funds. These instruments can be used to influence market prices and create profitable opportunities for investors. For example, a hedge fund may use a derivative to bet on a particular stock price, which can then be used to manipulate the market.

Vocabulary:

In addition to using complex financial instruments, manipulating financial markets can also involve the use of insider information, political connections, and other forms of influence'
